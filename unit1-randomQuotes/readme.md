**NOTE ABOUT SUBMISSION**
I would like to be graded based on the 'Exceed Expectations' rubric for this assignment. I am going for 'exceeding expectations', but am ok if it passes for 'meets expectations'.

This is the codebase for my first project in Treehouse's Full Stack Javascript Development Tech Degree program. It is a program that generates quotes, and chooses them randomly from an array of objects I have created. It then prints the quote and source (and year or citation, if applicable) to the 'quote-box' div in the index.html.

Check it out!

Thanks!
